# Customer-churn

Data Analysis Project: Customer Churn 
This project was developed focusing on finding cuustomer churn by performing data anlysis and visualization with python using Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).

Executed entirely on Google Colab.

Objective
The primary aim of this project is to analyze excel data of customer information  to uncover insights of customer churn to improve the business. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to support the research objectives.

Tools & Libraries

ðŸ“Š Key Findings
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.

Insights: 1) people who have used our services for a long time have stayed and people who have 
             used sevices , 1 or 2 months have churned.
          2) customer is likely to churn when he is using electronic check as a payment method.
